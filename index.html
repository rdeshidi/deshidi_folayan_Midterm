				<h2>TRAA Trout Hachery</h2>
				<p>The TRAA trout hatchery is a popular activity of the TRAA as it's a great teaching tool with regard to the life cycle of a trout. Those involved with the hatchery get to see firsthand the development stages of the egg and the fry before their final release destinations to area streams.
Volunteers attend to the operation every day to maintain the health and well-being of the trout. As the saying goes, many hands make light work.
There are ideally 2 members assigned for each day of the week. This is desirable as they can cover for each other and also allows us to match up anyone wanting to "learn the ropes" with an experienced mentor.
At this time there are still openings those wanting to be a part of the trout hatchery rotation. You can Contact Us or attend a TRAA General Meeting (see above) for more info.</p>

				<h2 class="hidden">Fish</h2><img src="images/Melchers_logo.jpg" alt="melchers"></section><p>Over the past couple of years the folks at Melchers Construction Ltd have offered up their beautiful boardroom for TRAA executive meetings. It's an ideal space with all the amenities required for us to accomplish all the "behind the scenes" work of the TRAA. Many thanks go out to the continued support of Melchers Construction Ltd.</p></div>
		    <div class="slide"><section class="image"><h2 class="hidden">Fish</h2><img src="images/guillevin.jpg" alt="guillevin"></section><p>Members of the trout hatchery rotation know the woes we've had with lighting in the hatchery. Even with larger fixtures installed a few years ago, it was still frustrating on days when the mercury dipped below -15C and the fluorescent technology just teased us with its dull flicker. Enter Mike Jeffries of Guillevin Greentech in London with nice set of bright and dependable (and new!) LED fixtures. Once they were installed it was like working in well-appointed laboratory.</p></div>
		    <div class="slide"><section class="image"><h2 class="hidden">Fish</h2><img src="images/muma_logo.jpg" alt="muma"></section><p>The TRAA voted unanimously to re-name the TRAA trout hatchery honouring Keith Wales' memory and his unselfish support of the TRAA's work in the London area, in particular Komoka Creek. Special thanks go out to Muma Manufacturing in St. Thomas for donating the beautiful laser-cut aluminum sign.</p></div>
		    <div class="slide"><section class="image"><h2 class="hidden">Fish</h2><img src="images/Try_logo.jpg" alt="Try"></section><p>After cleaning up the area around the TRAA shed and trout hatchery, our trailer was quite full and needed to be emptied. A big 'thank you' goes out to Rick Vandersluis and Mike Seabrook of Try Recycling who allowed the TRAA to empty the trailer at their facility free of charge.</p></div>

		    <div class="slideLast"><section class="image"><h2 class="hidden">Fish</h2><img src="images/AnglingSports_logo.jpg" alt="AnglingSports"></section><p>Before we could take the trailer to Try Recycling, we needed to get the spare tire for the trailer fixed. Pat Devincenzo, proprietor of Angling Sports, offered to get it repaired. Turns out the tire needed replacing and Pat took care of it.
Angling Sports also supplied cards for all TRAA members that entitle them to a discount equal to the tax on anything in the store.
Thanks Pat, your generosity is greatly appreciated.</p></div>
