			<h3>TRAA General Meeting<br>
7:00PM - Wednesday, January 9, 2019</h3>
<p>As part of the new you for 2019 why not start coming out to TRAA General Meetings. That way you're up on the latest details on TRAA news, plans and events.<br>

Also note that with the New Year, it is time to renew your TRAA membership if you haven't already!<br>

As always, guests are always welcome. If you're not a member feel free to drop in and check out what the TRAA is all about.<br>

We meet at the Western Ontario Fish & Game Protective Association clubhouse at 790 Southdale Road, London Ontario.</p>

<h3>Rod Building - Your First Time<br>
7:00PM - Mondays, February 18 through March 11, 2019</h3>
<p>This will be a series of informal, hands-on sessions that will result in a spinning or fly rod that you have assembled and finished yourself.<br>
This opportunity is open only to current members of the TRAA, WOFGPA and/or FCFFC.<br>
Registration will be closed when 15 paid-up participants have registered, or January 11, 2019, whichever comes first.<br>
An email with further details has been sent out. If you haven't received this email by Wednesday, December 19th, please Contact Us.<br>
Presented by: Thames River Anglers Association with the Western Ontario Fish & Game Protective Ass’n and the Forest City Fly Fishing Club.<br>
The Western Ontario Fish & Game Protective Association clubhouse is at 790 Southdale Road, London Ontario.</p>

<h3>Stream Habitat Work Party<br>
Took place on Saturday, October 13, 2018</h3>
<p>A few TRAA members cleared a number of fallen trees and other blockages on October 13th.<br>
Dan Shinkelshoek made a video of the proceedings and it's worth a look so click on the picture to view.<br>
If you have further questions about TRAA stream habitat projects and events, please come out to the TRAA General Meeting on Wednesday, November 14th or Contact Us.</p>

<h3>TRAA Gear is now available!<br>
Tee shirts, hats and stickers.</h3>
<p>Many of you have already ordered the TRAA tee shirts, but if you haven't you had better hurry because many sizes are almost sold out! These are a steal at $15 each.<br>
There are three different hat colours available: Clay Grey, Burnt Orange and Taupe. If you thought the tee's were a good deal, all three editions of these hats are also priced at $15 each.<br>
We now have some nice stickers featuring the TRAA logo that you can display on your vehicle, boat, lunchbox or wherever you like. These are $2 each but you get one for joining the TRAA as a member or renewing an existing TRAA membership.<br>
Get your TRAA Gear (makes a great Christmas gift!) at any TRAA event, such as this coming General Meeting.</p>
